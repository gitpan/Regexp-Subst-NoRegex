      Bugs fixed. Drastic simplification of "rnr_substr" algorithm,
      with many steps removed. "rnr_sop" algorithm about 50% rewritten
      to overcome many bugs found during real-world testing using
      Microsoft Word. Total number of tests doubled, each test
      representing another bug. It may even work correctly now.
